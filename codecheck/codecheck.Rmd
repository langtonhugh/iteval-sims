# Summary

The three R scripts comprising this project were fairly straightforward to execute. I had some issues getting the simulation script (`sim.R`) running. It kept throwing an error but the specifics were masked by the usage of `doParallel` -- you only get the error about "cannot open connection" but the problem was actually that the `results` folder did not exist. Once this was created, the script executed fine. The results folder is not necessary if users are only interested in producing the plots and tables in `replicate.R`, because by default that script loads in pre-computed simulated data. The full simulation had to be run overnight (~6 hours) on a standard laptop.

The figures are not saved automatically. Because each figure is constructed within a loop, I could not easily add in a `ggsave()` to save the figures using specific dimensions and DPI. The tables are generated automatically but the script appears to only generate the corresponding LaTeX syntax and print it to the Console. To actually do the codecheck, I copied the `replicate.R` code into a `.qmd` file and displayed the tables using `flextable`.

# Recommendations

I have raised an issue on the repository^[https://github.com/jeroenhoogland/iteval-sims/issues/1#issue-2762859630] to propose fixing the `results` folder problem.

The figures and tables could be saved automatically. As it stands, the scripts only output the results to either the R Console or the Plot window. This means that my reproduced figures differ slightly (e.g., dimensions, aspect ratio) from those in the paper, even though the results match. It also means that the code produces tables that are not labelled as per the paper, making it more difficult for readers to check their outputs to the results in the paper. Rmarkdown, `flextable`, and `ggsave` might be nice additions to solve this.

# About CODECHECK

This certificate confirms that the codechecker could independently
reproduce the results of a computational analysis given the data and
code from a third party.  A CODECHECK does not check whether the
original computation analysis is correct.  However, as all materials
required for the reproduction are freely available by following the
links in this document, the reader can then study for themselves the
code and data.
